# SUMO-Electrical-vehicle-Charge-Stations
SUMO: Electric Vehicle and Charging Stations Simulation
This project is developed using SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) to manage electric vehicle charging needs along predefined routes. The goal is to optimize vehicle routing based on battery levels, enhance station efficiency with algorithmic solutions, and model vehicle-charging station interactions using OCPP (Open Charge Point Protocol).

Technologies Used:
SUMO (Traffic simulation)
Python (Data analysis & routing algorithms)
OCPP 1.6 (Charging station communication protocol)
NetEdit (Map and route editor)
TraCI (Data exchange between SUMO and Python)
